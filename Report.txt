To compile:
   Open OnScreenKeyboard.sln in Visual Studio 2013 update 5.
   Select Build - Build Solution.

To run:
   From the command prompt, locate the OnScreenKeyboard.exe excutable.
   Then execute something like:
        OnScreenKeyboard ..\..\input.txt ..\..\output.txt
   You should see console output similar to:
	Input:
	IT Crowd
	Output:
	D,R,R,#,D,D,L,#,S,U,U,U,R,#,D,D,R,R,R,#,L,L,L,#,D,R,R,#,U,U,U,L,#
	Input:
	More cowbell
	Output:
	D,D,#,R,R,#,R,R,R,#,U,U,L,#,S,L,L,#,D,D,#,D,R,R,#,U,U,U,L,L,L,#,R,R,R,#,D,R,#,#
	Input:
	Klaatu barada nikto
	Output:
	D,R,R,R,R,#,R,#,U,L,L,L,L,L,#,#,D,D,D,R,#,R,#,S,U,U,U,L,#,L,#,D,D,R,R,R,R,R,#,U,
	U,L,L,L,L,L,#,R,R,R,#,L,L,L,#,S,D,D,R,#,U,R,#,R,R,#,D,D,L,L,L,#,U,R,#

   The output is also saved to the output file specified on the command line.

OnScreenKeyboard is the main project, and OnScreenKeyboardTest is for unit tests, which 
use the standard Visual Studio Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting framework.

In a production environment, better input validation, logging, dependency injection, 
unit tests, etc. would be needed. What's provided for this assignment is functional but 
bare-bones.

In production environments internationalization must be considered. To address this, all
locale-specific information (such as the displayed characters and keyboard layout) is encapsulated
in the KeyboardModel. So, for example, to implement a French keyboard just requires creating
a new KeyboardModel class that implements the IKeyboardModel interface.

KeyboardNavigator is the primary class, it takes a KeyboardModel and generates the keyboard
navigation sequence from the input string.

All the code is written just for this assignment, there is no "borrowed" code of any sort.
Sites like MSDN and StackOverflow were referenced for some code syntax questions.
